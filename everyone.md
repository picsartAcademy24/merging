# Everybody

I've got a felling
A felling deep inside - oh yeah
I've got a felling
A felling I can't hide. Oh no

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody put their feet up
Everybody had a face-life
Everybody had a new cup
