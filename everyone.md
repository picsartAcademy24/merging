# Everyone

I've got a felling
A felling deep inside - oh yeah
I've got a felling
A felling I can't hide. Oh no

Everyone had a hard year
Everyone had a good time
Everyone had a wet dream
Everyone saw the sun shine

Everyone had a hard year
Everyone let their hair down
Everyone pulled their socks up
Everyone put their foot down

Everyone had a hard year
Everyone put their feet up
Everyone had a face-life
Everyone had a new cup
